# # Basic-Big-O-notation-in-JS

_"Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity."_

##### **_Summary:_**
Big O notation can be describe as how fast or the number of operations an algorithm needs to perform on a given input. Having read serval debates as to whether it’s essential for a front-end developer to be aware of the Big O notation of their code. 
I think front-end developer would benefit by knowing about Big O notation because it will make them more aware of the efficiency of an algorithm.

Common Big O notations I will be looking at:
```
 • O(1)       Constant time algorithm
 • O(log(n))  Logarithmic time algorithm
 • O(n)       Linear time algorithm
 • O(n^2)     Quadratic time algorithm
 ```


Some skeptics would say its not the kind of performance consideration you would come across in front-end development. This is because you might be dealing with tens of thousands of items but in back-end development you could deal with millions or billions of items.  As you would be dealing with huge amounts of data in back-end development then Big O is considered very useful. I’m still convinced its very useful for front-end developers  to be aware of Big O notation.
